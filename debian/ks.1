.TH ks 1 "25 Apr 2020" "0.0.10.0-Man1.0" "Kernel Simulator"
.SH NAME
ks \- simulates our future-planned kernel 
.SH SYNOPSIS
ks [args]
.SH DESCRIPTION
ks is the launcher for Kernel Simulator, which simulates our kernel that will be done in the future. It provides the built-in simulated kernel, log-in software, shell, and a set of useful tools like the FTP client, SSH, IMAP shell, etc. It also features the filesystem and basic operations like list, cp(1), mv(1), etc.
.SH OPTIONS
It only takes an argument of the executable arguments, which will be described below in the next section. Actually, there are two types of arguments:
.SH SYSTEM ARGUMENTS
In Kernel Simulator, when it starts, it checks for command line arguments to see if they are passed or not, and if so, will execute the following:
.TP 4
.B createConf
Creates a configuration file, and exits. Currently, it is used for a companion app that has not been ported to Linux yet, called "Kernel Simulator Configuration Tool".
.TP 4
.B testMod
Compiles a specified mod file to check for errors. It takes the path to the mod as well as the file name as an argument. If the scripts are not being compiled, it will exit with error code 1. Else, returns error code 0.
.TP 4
.B testInteractive
Initializes the test shell where you can test several features of the kernel or the programs that are shipped inside the simulated system. When you exit the shell, it exits the application.
.TP 4
.B debug
Enables the debug functionality in the kernel. It enables the local debugging feature which lets the kernel log all debugging messages to a file in your user profile. It also enables the remote debugging feature that lets you see debugging messages remotely from another computer.
.TP 4
.B args
When started with this argument, it lets the kernel prompt you to specify kernel arguments. Notice that the kernel arguments and KS arguments are not the same.
.SH CI ARGUMENTS
In Kernel Simulator, the CI arguments are built specially for CI environments, mostly used to test some components.
.TP 4
.B CI-TestPrint
When specified, the kernel will print a message, and exits with error code 0.
.TP 4
.B CI-TestWdbg
Enables the debugging feature for the kernel. When it reaches the successful boot stage, it will print the file contents, and exit the kernel with error code 0.
.TP 4
.B CI-TestConfig
Tests creation of the configuration file, prints the newly created "kernelConfig.ini" file contents to the console, and exits with error code 0.
.TP 4
.B CI-TestInitialize
Tests starting up the kernel, and when it finishes, it prints out the time elapsed to start the kernel in milliseconds, and exits the kernel with error code 0.
.TP 4
.B CI-TestEval
Tests evaluating three variables using our "Evaluate" function and printing the results to the console. It exits the kernel with error code 0. If there are any errors, it exits with error code 1.
.TP 4
.B CI-TestStrTrunc
Tests string truncation function "Truncate", prints the result to the console, and exits the kernel with error code 0.
.TP 4
.B CI-TestSSEs
Prints all the available CPU instructions, and exits the kernel with error code 0. It currently tests SSE, SSE2, and SSE3 features.
.TP 4
.B CI-TestMOTD
It reads the message of the day file, prints the parsed message into the console, and exits the kernel.
.TP 4
.B CI-TestMAL
It reads the message of the day after login file, prints the parsed message into the console, and exits the kernel.
.TP 4
.B CI-TestPlace
Tests the placeholder parsing function for strings using system, timezone, and shortdate placeholders. It prints their results to the console, and exits the kernel.
.TP 4
.B CI-TestCalc
Tests the evaluation calculation feature using "DoCalc", prints the results to the console, and exits the kernel.
.SH BUGS
In some cases, VLC might fail to start with the message that it could not initialize the library if "speak" command is used.
