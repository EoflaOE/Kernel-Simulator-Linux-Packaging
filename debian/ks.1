.TH ks 1 "06 Nov 2020" "0.0.12.0-Man2.0" "Kernel Simulator"
.SH NAME
ks \- simulates our future-planned kernel 
.SH SYNOPSIS
ks [args]
.SH DESCRIPTION
ks is the launcher for Kernel Simulator, which simulates our kernel that will be done in the future. It provides the built-in simulated kernel, log-in software, shell, and a set of useful tools like the FTP client, SSH, IMAP shell, etc. It also features the filesystem and basic operations like list, cp(1), mv(1), etc.
.SH OPTIONS
It only takes an argument of the executable arguments, which will be described below in the next section. Actually, there are two types of arguments:
.SH SYSTEM ARGUMENTS
In Kernel Simulator, when it starts, it checks for command line arguments to see if they are passed or not, and if so, will execute the following:
.TP 4
.B testMod
Compiles a specified mod file to check for errors. It takes the path to the mod as well as the file name as an argument. If the scripts are not being compiled, it will exit with error code 1. Else, returns error code 0.
.TP 4
.B testInteractive
Initializes the test shell where you can test several features of the kernel or the programs that are shipped inside the simulated system. When you exit the shell, it exits the application.
.TP 4
.B debug
Enables the debug functionality in the kernel. It enables the local debugging feature which lets the kernel log all debugging messages to a file in your user profile. It also enables the remote debugging feature that lets you see debugging messages remotely from another computer.
.TP 4
.B args
When started with this argument, it lets the kernel prompt you to specify kernel arguments. Notice that the kernel arguments and KS arguments are not the same.
.SH BUGS
In some cases, VLC might fail to start with the message that it could not initialize the library if "speak" command is used.
